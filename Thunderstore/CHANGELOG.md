| 1.0.4     | - Clear the input field when attempting to copy a piece you are hovering (using vanilla Shift + Middle Click). Since it changes the build pieces available when the search box has a value in it. This could result in the inability to select the hovered piece in the hammer menu as it doesn't exist in the filtered pieces. Thank you to Sav for finding this issue. |
| 1.0.3     | - Recompile for Ashlands                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 1.0.2     | - I had it on the mod page, but hadn't implemented it yet. Implement a clear `X` button for easy clearing of the field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 1.0.1     | - Fix some logging. Guess I forgot to wrap that in #if DEBUG lmao                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
